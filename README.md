# Beans-to-Bar-R-Shiny


## INTRODUCTION:
Chocolates are one of the common cravings among people. Usually distributed during birthdays, it is a feast to the eyes, mouth and the soul. On most occasions, gifting a box
of chocolate is very well welcomed. The earliest evidence of chocolate can be traced back to pre-Colombian cultures of Mesoamerica which is now known as Mexico. Aztecs, the
indigenous people of Mesoamerica believed that the cocoa seeds were ’food of the gods’. In fact, the scientific name of the cocoa trees translates to “food of the gods”. The word
’Chocolate’ comes from the Aztec word ’Xocolatl’. According to the History Channel, the world’s first chocolate bar dates all the way back to 1847. It was created by Joseph Fry
with the help of his son, and they made it with cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and sugar.

Chocolates have been around for quite a while now. Since humans have this incessant need to invent and innovate, we now have countless number of varieties of chocolates.
Chocolates have over six hundred flavour compounds, which is three times the number of flavour compounds in red wine. We get chocolates mostly in two forms – solid and
liquid. Furthermore, we have different kinds of chocolates. Broadly, they are categorized into white, milk and dark chocolates.

Apart from their popularity due to their taste, chocolates also have an assortment of benefits. From improving mental health to reducing risk of cardiovascular diseases, chocolates are beneficial to humans in many ways. While dark chocolates are
considered to be the most nutritional, the other forms of chocolate bring their share of benefits to the table too. Overall, chocolates in limits are considered to be a part of a
healthy, balanced diet. 

All in all, we are very grateful to all those people who strives hard and continue to do so to fill the world with better chocolates each day.




## TITLE AND PROJECT STATEMENT:
**<ins>Title</ins>**

Our project is based primarily on chocolates and their ratings. We start at the ground level – the sourcing of the cocoa beans. The source of the cocoa beans determines the
chocolate’s taste, quality and texture. Hence, we thought it would be fitting to name "Beans to Bar"  as all chocolate bars are born from cocoa beans. The logo
contains two key elements – the cocoa bean and the chocolate bar.

To understand the different ratings of chocolates, the various factors and the various ways in which these factors affect the chocolate ratings.
